                <p>The development of this website was initially a bit challenging. However, through essential web development skills and further research, a full functioning website was achieved. The research was undertaken to see the expected format for a personal portfolio.  A few ideas were found for the website design that could be used,some of the ideas were derived from the following pages, then on a piece of paper, the frame and design were drawn, to visualise the design that was trying to be achieved.To get started, the contents of the pages were coding in HTML. The following images are the will show first,the  design inspiration ,output of the intial stages of the web development, webpage(left) and mobile view(right): 
                </p>
            </div>

                 Personally, a few issues occurred during the creation of this webpage. Firstly, there was a struggle with placing the elements within a grid layout. Elements would be too small and not visible once the webpage was loaded, or it was too big and overlapped other elements once the webpage had loaded. Secondly, adjusting the webpages' dimensions to suit the mobile view, some images and elements had to be abandoned to create a perfect mobile web page. Additionally, It was challenging to find attractive colours. However, I can confidently say that I enjoyed creating this webpage and I look forward to developing my skills more. 
                 
                 These are the final images, showing the output of the final pages:
                </p>
            </div>
            
            
            
            <div class="images2">
                <img src="images/homepage.png" alt="contact page" class="index-img">
                <img src="images/mobile view.png" alt="contact page" class="index-img">
            </div>
            <div class="report">
                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>The issues that were faced with the overlapping of elements in the grid were resolved by simply readjusting the elements accordingly. Additionally, once I ran my code through the validator some errors popped up and they were immediately resolved
                Below are a few images of the validated code:</p>
