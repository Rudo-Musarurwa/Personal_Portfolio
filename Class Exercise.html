            <li>Co-requisites: None</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Assessment: STD - Computer Systems Coursework: 100% STDFF - Computer Systems (4 Year Programme) Coursework: 100% 19ES - Computer Systems (Edulink International Campus Sri Lanka) September Coursework: 100%</p>
               
        <p> Designated for: Designated for: Beng Computing (Computer Network Engineering); Beng Electrical & Electronic Engineering; BSc Business Computing (Systems); BSc Computing; BSc Computing (Graphics & Visualisation); BSc Computing (Mobile Computing); BSc Computing (Software Engineering); BSc Computing (Web Technology & Security); HNC Computing;</p>
    
        <p>Description: This module provides basic knowledge of the hardware and software components that make up a computer system. Modern computer systems not only consist of just the computer but also include a range of peripherals. The module gives an overview of all the important concepts in preparation for a deeper study of computer systems.Learning environments are offered to enable students to gain a basic comprehension understanding and appreciation of computer system concepts and technologies and the skills to use them to the best effect</p>
